# TAOCP Adventures
My adventures in Donald Knuth's classic The Art of Computer Programing. Exercises are written in LaTeX or otherwise programmed in Swift and Rust (yes, both and separately). 


## Format
For exercises that require written form, I will be using LaTeX. PDF's in a separate folder will also be pushed to the repo for convenient access by **chapter**. 
Programming exercises will be done in Swift and Rust. Yes, both and separately. 

### Why Swift?
Because I love Swift. 

### Why do you love it? 
I'm not sure, I ask myself this quite often. It's interesting to me. 


### Why Rust?
Because I want to git gud at Rust :^) . If you're interested, I can explain my reasoning for learning Rust and this Trial by Fire method of becoming proficient with it. 

#### Real trends vs. Fake trends
Sam Altman has a great lecture on succeed with start-ups, and in particular on how to spot market trends: 
>https://www.ycombinator.com/library/89-how-to-succeed-with-a-startup-sus-2018

To run it down, he explains that real trends have few early adopters, but those few absolutely love the product. A good example is the first iPhone, not many bought the first iPhone but the people who did were obssessed with it and were on it all day. An example of a fake trend is Virtual Reality (VR), people keep saying VR is the next big thing but people who have VR headsets aren't using it constantly or absolutely in love with it. 

What's my point and what does this have to do with Rust? 

#### My logic is that Rust could be very much a real trend. 
Take a look at the most recent StackOverflow survey on the Most Love Languages:
>https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted\

For five years running Rust has been the Most Loved language by developers. Yet alone, the 2020 survey reveal that it's still the most loved, and it's not even close.
